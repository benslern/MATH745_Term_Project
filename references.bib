	abstract = {We present evidence on the global existence of solutions of De Gregorio's equation, based on numerical computation and a mathematical criterion analogous to the Beale–Kato–Majda theorem. Its meaning in the context of a generalized Constantin–Lax–Majda equation will be discussed. We then argue that a convection term, if set in a proper form and in a proper magnitude, can deplete solutions of blow-up.},

	abstract = {The one-dimensional model for the three-dimensional vorticity equation proposed by Constantin, Lax, and Majda is discussed. Some unsatisfactory points are examined, especially when the viscosity is introduced. A different model is suggested, which, while less solvable than the previous one, can be more strictly connected with the three-dimensional vorticity behavior. The study is of interest for the numerical treatment of the three-dimensional vorticity equation.},

This simple model is solved exactly; despite its simplicity, this equation retains several of the most important structural features in the vorticity equations and its solutions exhibit some of the phenomena observed in numerical computations for breakdown for the 3-D Euler equations.},
